I'm happy to share that iteration 1 of our new documentation is live. Even if all the features are not yet live, it should help anyone understand what we are after.

We've been spending many hours creating crisp and simple reference documentation as if it were a proper manual for any physical product. 

1) Goals: 

- Build trust in AI with our suite of AI Assistants (AIA is your personal AI Assistant, ABI is your Mixture of Assistants, and you can also add Custom Assistants, Chat & Search)

- Map Business Knowledge with an ABI knowledge graph based on content as a strategic priority to build a sales pipeline and conversations to build operational excellence.

- Unlock Monetization with the marketplace so anyone can have their own version of chatGPT and its GPT store. 

2) Safety considerations 

3) Platform deep dive, where we explain the frameworks we embedded in the platform, the key horizontal and vertical features, technology components, and pricing. 

4) Installation: how to get on board, setup your profile, workspace setup 

5) Usage: playing with different LLMs, building your AIA, deep diving into ABI Assistants SOPs, creating custom Assistants 

6) Services: all the open source code and APIs we have to maintain to make this happen

7) Resources: everything around community, help center, developers tooling

8) Terms & Policies
