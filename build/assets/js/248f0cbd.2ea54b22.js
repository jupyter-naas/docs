For many years, CCO development and application were conducted with limited transparency.

This public availability has significantly increased interest in CCO development. Notably, in 2022, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) P3195 Standard for Requirements for a Mid-Level Ontology and Extensions working group initiated a review of CCO to establish it as the first mid-level ontology standard.
