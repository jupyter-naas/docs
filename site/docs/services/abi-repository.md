# ABI Repository
---

## Description

The ABI Repository is a foundational component of the NAAS ecosystem designed to empower users with the ability to create a dynamic mixture of AI-driven agents. This Data Product serves as a crucial tool for those looking to harness the power of artificial intelligence to streamline operations, enhance decision-making, and unlock new insights within their data.

ABI, short for Artificial Business Intelligence, provides a versatile foundation for integrating AI capabilities into your workflows, enabling you to leverage a wide array of models for data analysis, prediction, automation, and more.

## License
ABI is committed to fostering innovation and accessibility in the AI community, which is why it is available under an OpenSource license. This approach ensures that users can contribute to, modify, and distribute the repository while benefiting from collaborative advancements.

## Cost
The ABI repository itself is free to use, democratizing access to advanced AI tools. However, deploying and leveraging the agents created with ABI may require the use of paid services within the Naas infrastructure to access the full spectrum of capabilities and ensure optimal performance.
