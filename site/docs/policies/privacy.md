## 1. What this Privacy Policy Covers

This Privacy Policy covers how we treat Personal Data that we gather when you — including as an Individual Customer — access or use our Services. "Personal Data" means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual and also includes information referred to as "personally identifiable information" or "personal information" under applicable data privacy laws, rules, or regulations.

Naas allows both Individual Customers and Enterprise Customers to create an account through Naas' websites to access the Naas Products. Naas offers a suite of business-to-business offerings and, in the ordinary course of providing those products, we may process personal data at the direction of our Enterprise Customers. This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data use practices in connection with personal data collected from or on behalf of our Enterprise Customer. The Enterprise Customer (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into a Master Service Agreement, applicable terms, or another written agreement executed by us controls such data.

If you have any questions related to that Enterprise Customer's settings or privacy practices, please contact such organization. If we process your personal data on behalf of one of our Enterprise Customers and you wish to discontinue such processing, or if you seek to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal data, please directly contact the organization on whose behalf we are processing such personal data. We will follow the Enterprise Customer's instructions with regard to the personal data at issue. We will retain such personal data pursuant to our retention policy and will retain it as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies we don't own or control, such as our Enterprise Customers, or people we don't manage.
