# Build Trust in AI

## Our Philosophy: From Data to Wisdom

The journey from raw data to actionable wisdom is both complex and transformative. At NAAS, we've built our platform around the Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom (DIKW) framework - the same foundational approach that powered companies like Google to success.

Our implementation of this framework consists of four distinct layers:

1. **Foundation Layer**: General chat and search capabilities to access data assets
2. **Custom Assistants Layer**: Specialized AI agents that can be chained together for specific outcomes
3. **Business Intelligence Layer**: ABI (Augmented Business Intelligence) - a network of domain experts providing specialized knowledge in relying on ontologies:
   - Open Data
   - Content
   - Marketing
   - Sales
   - Operations
   - Finance

4. **Wisdom Layer**: Your personal AI trusted assistant (AIA) that:
   - Integrates insights from all lower layers
   - Provides contextualized decision support per user thanks to a dedicated personal ontology
   - Helps solve business challenges from awareness to revenue

This pyramid structure doesn't just organize data - it transforms it into actionable insights that drive business growth and informed decision-making.
