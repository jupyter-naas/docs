```python
# Naas data integration example
from naas_drivers import notion, salesforce, database

# Unified data access pattern
notion_data = notion.connect(api_key).get_pages()
crm_data = salesforce.connect(credentials).get_accounts()
db_data = database.connect(url).query("SELECT * FROM customers")
```

#### Foundry Integration
- **Pre-built connectors**: Enterprise-grade connectors for major systems
- **Data lineage**: Automatic tracking of data transformations and dependencies
- **Schema management**: Automatic schema detection and evolution
- **Spark processing**: Built-in distributed computing for large datasets
