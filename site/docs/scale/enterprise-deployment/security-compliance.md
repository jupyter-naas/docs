# Security & Compliance

Naas implements enterprise-grade security controls and compliance frameworks to meet the most stringent organizational requirements. Our security-by-design approach ensures data protection, regulatory compliance, and operational security across all deployment models.

## Security Architecture

### Zero Trust Security Model

Naas implements a comprehensive zero trust security architecture that assumes no implicit trust and continuously validates every transaction.

**Core Principles**:
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal access rights for users and systems
- **Assume Breach**: Design for containment and rapid response
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and analysis

**Implementation Framework**:
