# Deployment Models

Naas supports multiple deployment models to meet diverse enterprise requirements, from cloud-native SaaS deployments to air-gapped government installations. Each model is designed to maintain full platform functionality while meeting specific security, compliance, and operational needs.

:::info Professional Services Implementation
The enterprise capabilities described in this section represent our ability to implement these solutions through our professional services team. Each deployment is customized to your specific requirements and implemented with dedicated support. Contact our enterprise team at [support@naas.ai](mailto:support@naas.ai) to discuss your needs and implementation timeline.

## Cloud-Native Deployment

### Kubernetes-Native Architecture

Naas is built from the ground up as a cloud-native application, leveraging Kubernetes for container orchestration and management.

**Core Components**:
- **Control Plane**: Manages platform configuration, user management, and orchestration
- **Agent Runtime**: Executes AI agents with auto-scaling based on demand
- **Data Layer**: Distributed storage with automatic replication and backup
- **API Gateway**: Secure API access with rate limiting and authentication

**Kubernetes Resources**:
```yaml
# Example Naas deployment configuration
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: naas-platform
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: naas-platform
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: naas-api
        image: naas/platform:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "1000m"
          limits:
            memory: "4Gi"
            cpu: "2000m"
```

### Multi-Region Deployment

**Global Distribution Strategy**:
- **Primary Region**: Main deployment with full functionality
- **Secondary Regions**: Read replicas with failover capability
- **Edge Locations**: Cached responses for improved performance
- **Data Residency**: Configurable data storage locations for compliance
