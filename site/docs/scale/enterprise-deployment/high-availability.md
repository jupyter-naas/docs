# High Availability & Disaster Recovery

Naas is architected for enterprise-grade availability and resilience, with comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities that ensure business continuity even in the face of major infrastructure failures. Our multi-layered approach to availability provides 99.9%+ uptime guarantees with rapid recovery capabilities.

## High Availability Architecture

### Multi-Zone Deployment

**Availability Zone Strategy**:
- **Primary Zone**: Main operational zone with full capacity
- **Secondary Zones**: Hot standby zones with automatic failover
- **Cross-Zone Replication**: Real-time data replication across zones
- **Load Distribution**: Intelligent traffic distribution across zones

**Zone Failure Scenarios**:

graph TD
    subgraph "Zone A (Primary)"
        A1[API Gateway]
        A2[Application Services]
        A3[Database Primary]
    end
    
    subgraph "Zone B (Secondary)"
        B1[API Gateway]
        B2[Application Services]
        B3[Database Replica]
    end
    
    subgraph "Zone C (Tertiary)"
        C1[API Gateway]
        C2[Application Services]
        C3[Database Replica]
    end
    
    LB[Load Balancer]
    
    LB --> A1
    LB --> B1
    LB --> C1
    
    A3 --> B3
    A3 --> C3
    
    class A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3 platform
    class LB infrastructure
```

**Automatic Failover Configuration**:
```yaml
# High availability configuration
high_availability:
  zones:
    primary: "us-east-1a"
    secondary: ["us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  
  failover:
    detection_timeout: "30 seconds"
    failover_time: "2 minutes"
    automatic: true
    health_checks:
      - endpoint: "/health"
        interval: "10 seconds"
        timeout: "5 seconds"
        retries: 3
  
  load_balancing:
    algorithm: "least_connections"
    sticky_sessions: false
    health_check_grace_period: "60 seconds"
```

### Database High Availability

**PostgreSQL High Availability**:
- **Streaming Replication**: Synchronous replication for zero data loss
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer for connection management
- **Automatic Failover**: Patroni for automated failover management
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Continuous WAL archiving

  cluster_name: "naas-postgres"
  
  nodes:
    primary:
      name: "postgres-primary"
      zone: "us-east-1a"
      instance_type: "db.r5.2xlarge"
    
    replicas:
      - name: "postgres-replica-1"
        zone: "us-east-1b"
        instance_type: "db.r5.2xlarge"
        replication: "synchronous"
      
      - name: "postgres-replica-2"
        zone: "us-east-1c"

app = FastAPI()

class HealthChecker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.checks = {
            "database": self.check_database,
            "redis": self.check_redis,
            "external_api": self.check_external_api
        }
    
    async def check_database(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        try:
            # Database connectivity check
            result = await db.execute("SELECT 1")
            return {
                "status": "healthy",
                "response_time": 0.05,
                "details": "Database connection successful"
            }
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "status": "unhealthy",
                "error": str(e),
                "details": "Database connection failed"
            }
    
    async def check_redis(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        try:
            # Redis connectivity check
            await redis.ping()
            return {
                "status": "healthy",
                "response_time": 0.02,
                "details": "Redis connection successful"
            }
        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "status": "unhealthy",
                "error": str(e),
                "details": "Redis connection failed"
            }

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    checker = HealthChecker()
    results = {}
    overall_status = "healthy"
    
    for check_name, check_func in checker.checks.items():
        result = await check_func()
        results[check_name] = result
        if result["status"] != "healthy":
            overall_status = "unhealthy"
    
    return {
        "status": overall_status,
        "timestamp": time.time(),
        "checks": results
    }
```
