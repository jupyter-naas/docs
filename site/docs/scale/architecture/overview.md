# Architecture Overview

Naas implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that enables complex AI workflows combining reasoning, tool usage, and collaborative problem-solving. The platform is built on proven open-source foundations while providing enterprise-grade scalability and security.

## Platform Architecture

The Naas platform consists of three interconnected layers that work together to provide comprehensive AI capabilities:

**The three-layer architecture enables:**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities while maintaining clean interfaces
- **Scalability**: Layers can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Flexibility**: Components can be swapped or extended without affecting other layers
- **Security**: Security controls can be applied at appropriate architectural boundaries

## Core Components

### Multi-Agent System
The heart of Naas's AI capabilities, built on LangGraph for stateful agent interactions. Agents can collaborate, delegate tasks, and maintain context across complex workflows.

### Ontology Engine  
Formal knowledge representation using W3C standards (RDF/OWL) that enables semantic reasoning and data integration. The ontology serves as the "unifying field" connecting data, models, and workflows.

### Memory & Context Management
Persistent conversation history and knowledge retention using vector databases and graph storage. Enables agents to maintain context across sessions and learn from interactions.

### Tool Integration Framework
Standardized patterns for connecting external systems, databases, APIs, and services. Tools are automatically exposed to agents through the LangGraph framework.

## Deployment Models

### Local Development
- **ABI CLI**: Complete AI operating system running locally
- **Jupyter Integration**: Native notebook environment for rapid prototyping  
- **Offline Capable**: Full functionality without cloud dependencies
- **Model Flexibility**: Support for local, cloud, or hybrid model deployment

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes Native**: Container orchestration for production scaling
- **Multi-Region**: Global deployment with data residency controls
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on workload
- **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy and failover capabilities

### Hybrid Architecture
- **Local + Cloud**: Combine local development with cloud infrastructure
- **Edge Computing**: Deploy agents closer to data sources
- **Air-Gapped**: Complete offline operation for maximum security
- **Federated**: Multi-organization deployments with shared ontologies

## Integration Patterns

### Data Integration
The platform supports multiple data integration patterns to connect with existing enterprise systems:

- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, key management
- **Audit & Compliance**: Comprehensive logging, compliance reporting

### Zero Trust Model
The platform implements zero trust principles:

- **Verify Explicitly**: Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and services
- **Assume Breach**: Continuous monitoring and incident response
