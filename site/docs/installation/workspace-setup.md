# Workspace setup
---
By default, we will create a Personal Workspace for you. Each workspace serves as a hub for organizations, project management and collaboration. Tailoring these workspaces to align with you, your team's objectives and workflows is pivotal for maximizing productivity and leveraging the platform's capabilities.

## Workspace creation
From the profile dropdown, access your personal workspace or create a new one for your team. When you click on “+ New Workspace”, you can assign a name to your workspace, invite collaborators via email, and define the workspace's scope. The flexibility to establish multiple workspaces allows for the segmentation of projects and team collaboration.

## Customization and Branding
Customize your workspace to reflect your company's brand identity and operational needs. This includes selecting themes, configuring widgets for quick access to frequently used tools or data, and adjusting notification settings for critical updates.

## Billing Configuration 
Configure billing at the workspace level to manage platform usage and related costs efficiently. This approach ensures transparency and facilitates budgeting, regardless of whether you're a solo user managing a personal workspace or part of a team managing shared resources.


## Connections
In the Connections panel, you can establish links to a variety of platforms, enabling seamless integration and access to your data across different services.


## Marketplace 
The marketplace is a feature designed to enhance your account by providing a curated selection of products and services. By browsing the marketplace, you can easily discover and install AI models, functions, assistants or applications that complement and extend the functionality of your workspace. This allows for a more customized and efficient experience, tailored to meet your specific needs and integrate AI into your workflows.
