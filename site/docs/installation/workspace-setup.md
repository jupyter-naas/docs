# Workspace setup
---
By default, we will create a Personal Workspace for you. Each workspace serves as a hub for organizations, project management and collaboration. Tailoring these workspaces to align with you, your team's objectives and workflows is pivotal for maximizing productivity and leveraging the platform's capabilities.

## Workspace creation
From the profile dropdown, access your personal workspace or create a new one for your team. When you click on “+ New Workspace”, you can assign a name to your workspace, invite collaborators via email, and define the workspace's scope. The flexibility to establish multiple workspaces allows for the segmentation of projects and team collaboration.

## Dashboard
The dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview of your workspace, with all the credits consumptions happening on the platform. We also plan to add customizable reports for monitoring key metrics, activity feeds, calendars, and quick access to frequently used tools and resources.

By browsing the marketplace, you can easily discover and install AI models, functions, assistants or applications that complement and extend the functionality of your workspace. This allows for a more customized and efficient experience, tailored to meet your specific needs and integrate AI into your workflows.
