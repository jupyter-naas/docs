# Bubble

[Bubble.io](https://bubble.io) is a powerful no-code platform that enables you to build and customize web applications without writing a single line of code. The platform offers a drag-and-drop interface for designing your app and a workflow-based approach for defining the app's functionality. With Bubble.io, you can rapidly develop and deploy scalable, production-ready applications.

## Triggering Workflows

One of Bubble.io's key features is its ability to create and manage workflows â€” sequences of events defined by the application logic. With the Naas Drivers library, you can programmatically trigger these workflows from your Python environment.

Here's an example of how to send data to a Bubble.io workflow:

```python
import naas_drivers

url = "https://appname.bubbleapps.io/api/1.1/wf/endpoint_name"
data = { "first_name":"Bryan", "last_name":"Helmig", "age": 27 }

result = naas_drivers.bubble.send(url, data)
```

In this example, `url` refers to the workflow endpoint URL, and `data` is the JSON object containing the data you wish to send to the workflow.
