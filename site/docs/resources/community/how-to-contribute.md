### Commit Convention at Naas

At Naas, we adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification. This is a simple, yet effective convention for structuring commit messages. It provides a set of easy-to-follow rules that facilitate the creation of a clear and explicit commit history, making it more straightforward to develop automated tools.

When contributing to Naas, we use the following commit types to communicate the nature of the changes:

- `fix`: Used when patching a bug.
- `feat`: Used when introducing a new feature.
- `docs`: Used when documenting a feature or a fix.
- `style`: Used when making changes to the UX design of a feature.
- `refactor`: Used when altering the way a feature works without changing its external behavior.
- `test`: Used when adding unit tests to the project.

Please note that this commit convention applies to both the Naas and Naas drivers repositories. By adhering to these conventions, we can maintain a clean, organized, and easily navigable commit history.
