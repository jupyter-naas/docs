## Overview
ABI is a sophisticated mixture of AI-driven business intelligence assistants, each designed to elevate and refine the efficiency of business operations. It is the primary product of the Naas Marketplace. This suite of assistants has been designed by our core team to cover business essentials with 6 assistants focused on content creation, growth marketing, sales conversion, operational efficiency, finance management and open data & market intelligence. Together, they form a cohesive system that enhances content performance, improves lead generation and qualification, streamlines operations and financial transactions, and utilizes external data for richer business insights. ABI's capabilities are further expanded through its integration with a variety of tools, APIs, both official and unofficial, enabling comprehensive data collection and enrichment.

## Standard Operating Procedures

ABI can be configured for either a single entity or multiple entities, which may represent individuals or organizations. Each ABI Assistant is accountable for its own business domain and data collection. They adhere to a standard operating procedure that forms the backbone of their functionality. This core procedure can be further tailor-made by the users to incorporate specific workflows or tool integrations.
