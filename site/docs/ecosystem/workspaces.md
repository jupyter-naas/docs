# Workspace

Naas Workspace is a powerful React application designed to provide a seamless experience for building and managing data products using Naas v2. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive set of features, Naas OS simplifies the process of developing, launching, and scaling data products for both individuals and teams.

## Features

### Template Search
Naas Search offers a built-in search functionality to help you find and explore the extensive collection of notebook templates available. These templates cover a wide range of use cases and industries, allowing you to quickly prototype and iterate on new data products.
    
###  Universal Chat
MychatGPT is the universal chat feature in Naas Workspace enabling you to leverage various large language models, such as GPT, LLaMa, Cohere, to create sophisticated data products. By integrating these language models, you can build data products that analyze and understand large amounts of text data and generate relevant responses or recommendations.
    
### Access to JupyterLab
Naas OS provides seamless access to JupyterLab, we call it Naas Lab, a powerful data science platform equipped with Jupyter Lab and Dask. With JupyterLab, you can perform advanced data analysis, create interactive visualizations, and build scalable data pipelines, all within a collaborative and cloud-based environment.

### Admin Section
The admin section in Naas OS allows you to monitor essential aspects of your data products, including jobs, events, and credit consumption. This feature provides you with real-time insights into the performance and usage of your data products, enabling you to optimize and manage them effectively.
