# Quickstart

Get started with the Naas platform in minutes - no installation required.

## Cloud Platform Access

### 1. Create Your Account

Visit [naas.ai](https://naas.ai) and create your free account:

1. **Sign up** with email or GitHub
2. **Verify your email** address
3. **Complete onboarding** - choose your role and interests
4. **Optional: Connect LinkedIn** - Create your personalized AIA assistant
5. **Access your workspace** - you're ready to go!

### 2. Your First AI Interaction

Once in your workspace, experience how AI + ontologies create intelligent, personalized systems:

#### Experience AIA - Your Personal AI Assistant

If you've added your LinkedIn profile during onboarding, you'll interact with AIA, your personalized AI assistant:

*AIA knows your professional background from LinkedIn and provides personalized insights based on your ontology*

**Try it yourself**:
```
Ask: "Based on my background, what should I focus on this quarter?"
```

#### See AI + Ontology Integration

![Ontology Integration](/aia/2-discover-ai-ontology-linking.png)
*Watch how your data becomes structured knowledge that powers intelligent conversations*

#### Explore Your Knowledge Networks

![Ontology Manager](/aia/3-discover-ontology-manager.png)
*Explore your personal ontology as an interactive knowledge graph with entities and relationships*

#### Advanced: Developer Control

![YAML Editor](/aia/4-discover-ontology-yaml-editor.png)
*Full technical control with YAML-based ontology editing for custom AI assistant creation*

#### Ready for More?

**Create Your Own AI Assistants**:
Beyond AIA, you can build custom AI assistants tailored to your specific needs:
- **Choose your AI model** - Connect to OpenAI, Claude, LLama, Mistra, or others
- **Design custom ontologies** - Structure your domain knowledge using the visual ontology manager
- **Chat with @YourAssistant** - Call your custom assistants directly in conversations

<!-- TODO: Add comprehensive guide for creating custom AI assistants with ontology editor and model selection -->

### 3. Chrome Extension Setup

Bring AI assistance to any website:

1. **Install Extension** from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)
2. **Login** with your Naas account
3. **Convenient sidebar access** - Your AI assistants available as you browse

<!-- TODO: Add text highlighting and page analysis features for Chrome extension -->
<!-- TODO: Add browser control capabilities for advanced automation -->

The extension provides sidebar access to your AI assistants while browsing. Future updates will add text highlighting, page analysis, and browser automation features.

### 4. Team Collaboration (Pro Plan)

**Team Workspace Access**:
With a Pro plan, you can invite team members to collaborate in your workspace. This enables your team to work with a shared suite of AI assistants and access premium AI models together - similar to ChatGPT Pro and its GPTs, but with your custom ontology-powered assistants.

**Team Benefits**:
- Shared access to all custom AI assistants
- Collaborative ontology development
- Premium model access for the entire team
