This is the glossary for the National Center for Ontological Research.

## A

**Adequatism**: The principle that an ontology should be designed to include all entities that are relevant to the domain being modeled, without artificially restricting the scope.

**Adjacent_to**: A spatial relation in BFO between entities that share a boundary.

**Aristotelian definition**: A definition that follows the form of genus-differentia, specifying what kind the defined entity is and how it differs from other members of that kind.

**Artifact**: A material entity created or modified for a specific purpose through intentional human activity.

## B

**Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)**: A top-level ontology designed to support information integration, retrieval and analysis across diverse domains. BFO is characterized by its realist approach and provides a framework of formally defined terms representing basic entities such as objects, processes, functions, and roles.

**BFO 2.0**: The second major version of the Basic Formal Ontology, providing a more comprehensive framework for ontological modeling.

**Boundary**: In BFO, a lower-dimensional entity that serves as the extremity of an entity and is dependent on that entity.

## C

**Capability**: A disposition whose realizations are associated with the satisfaction of some interest on the part of some organism or group of organisms.

**Class**: A category of entities that share common characteristics.

**Conceptology**: The study of concepts, as distinguished from ontology, which is concerned with real-world entities.

**Conceptualism**: The philosophical position that universals exist only within the mind or as mental constructs.

**Continuant**: An entity that persists, endures, or continues to exist through time while maintaining its identity. Contrasted with occurrent.

**Continuant_part_of**: A foundational relation in BFO indicating that one continuant is part of another.

## D

**Derives_from**: A temporal relation in BFO indicating the historical connection between entities where one develops from another.

**Defined Class**: A class that is specified by a definition giving necessary and sufficient conditions for membership.

**Disposition**: A realizable entity that exists because of certain features of its bearer, and which can be realized in certain processes under specific circumstances.

**Domain Ontology**: An ontology that models a specific subject area or domain of interest, such as medicine, finance, or engineering.

## E

**Entity**: The most general type in BFO, encompassing everything that exists.

## F

**Fallibilism**: The principle that an ontology may contain errors and should be subject to revision as knowledge advances.

**Fiat Object Part**: A material entity that is part of an object but does not have physical boundaries corresponding to structural discontinuities.

**Formal Ontology**: An ontology concerned with general categories applicable across domains.

**Function**: A special kind of disposition that exists because the bearer has been designed or selected to realize processes of a certain sort.

## G

**Generically Dependent Continuant**: An entity that depends on one or more independent continuants but can migrate from one bearer to another through copying.

**Granularity**: The level of detail represented in an ontology.

## H

**Has_participant**: A relation between a process and a continuant that participates in that process.

**History**: In BFO, the totality of processes that occur in the spatiotemporal region occupied by a material entity.

## I

**Independent Continuant**: A continuant that does not depend for its existence on any other entity.

**Immaterial Entity**: A continuant that is not a material entity, including spatial regions and boundaries.

**Information Artifact Ontology (IAO)**: An ontology dealing with information entities, documents, databases, and related entities.

**Interoperability**: The ability of different ontologies or systems to work together without special effort.

**Is_a**: The foundational relation in ontologies, indicating that one type is a subtype of another.

## M

**Material Entity**: A continuant that has mass and is made of matter.

**Material Ontology**: An ontology concerned with specific kinds of entities in specific domains.

## O

**Object**: A material entity that has a relatively stable form and is spatially extended, maximally self-connected, and self-contained.

**Object Aggregate**: A material entity consisting of multiple objects that are not physically connected.

**Occurrent**: An entity that happens, unfolds, or develops through time. Examples include processes and events.

**Occurrent_part_of**: A foundational relation in BFO indicating that one occurrent is part of another.

**Ontological Realism**: The philosophical position that universals exist in reality independent of human thought or language.

**Ontology**: A formal representation of the entities, types, properties, and relations that exist in a domain, designed to enable knowledge sharing and reuse.

## P

**Particular**: An individual entity, as contrasted with a universal.

**Perspectivalism**: The principle that an ontology represents one among multiple legitimate perspectives on reality.

**Preceded_by**: A temporal relation in BFO indicating that one process occurs earlier than another.

**Process**: An occurrent that has temporal parts and depends on some material entity.

**Process Boundary**: A temporal boundary of a process.

**Process Profile**: A pattern of processes that occur over time.

**Process Characteristic**: The counterpart of 'quality' for processes.

## Q

**Quality**: A specifically dependent continuant that is exhibited if it inheres in an entity.

## R

**Realizable Entity**: A specifically dependent continuant that is not exhibited during its existence but can manifest in specific processes.

**Realism**: The philosophical position that reality exists independently of human thought and perception.

**Relational Quality**: A quality that depends on multiple bearers.

**Representational Artifact**: An artifact that represents something beyond itself.

**Role**: A realizable entity that exists because of some external circumstances and is not essential to its bearer.

## S

**Site**: An immaterial entity that provides for the possibility of containment.

**Spatial Region**: An immaterial entity that is a part of space.

**Spatiotemporal Region**: A region that has both spatial and temporal dimensions.

**Specifically Dependent Continuant**: A continuant that depends for its existence on a specific independent continuant.

**System**: An object aggregate whose members interact with each other.

## T

**Taxonomy**: A hierarchical classification of entities.

**Temporal Region**: A part of time, as distinct from space.

**Top-Level Ontology**: An ontology that defines very general categories applicable across all domains.

## U

**Universal**: A repeatable feature of reality, instantiated by particulars. In BFO, universals are contrasted with classes.

**Universal-Universal Relation**: A relation between types or universals, such as is_a or part_of.

**Universal-Particular Relation**: A relation between a universal and an instance, such as instantiation.

**Use-Mention Distinction**: The distinction between using a term to refer to something and mentioning the term itself.
