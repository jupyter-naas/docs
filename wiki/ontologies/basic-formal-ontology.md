## What is BFO?

BFO is a top-level ontology that provides a common framework for describing the fundamental concepts of reality. It is used in a wide range of applications, including ontology development, knowledge representation, and semantic web technologies.

Basic Formal Ontology is currently being used by over 450 ontology-based research projects in biomedical informatics and increasingly in other fields. The course will provide an introduction to the content and use of BFO in ontology development. Attendees will acquire knowledge of the ontology and of its use as top-level ontology in multiple ontology development projects in a variety of fields. They will learn about the most recent developments in the ontology and acquire basic knowledge of the draft version 2.0.

The current version of the draft Specification and User Guide for BFO 2.0 is available [here](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/Reference).

The current version of the draft BFO 2.0 OWL file is available [here](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl). Please read the [release notes](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2012-07-20/ReleaseNotes)

BFO introduction has been given at the [BFO Workshop 2012](http://ncorwiki.buffalo.edu/index.php/WORKSHOP,_Buffalo,_August_18-19,_2012#WORKSHOP.2C_Buffalo.2C_August_18-19.2C_2012)

### What is BFO 2020?

BFO 2020 is the latest version of BFO, which includes a number of new features and improvements over previous versions.

### ISO Standardization

BFO 2020 has been standardized by ISO as ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021. This standard is part of a two-part series:

2. ISO/IEC 21838-2:2021 - Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
   - Published November 2021
   - Standardizes BFO 2020 as a top-level ontology conforming to Part 1
   - Available at [ISO 74572](https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html)
